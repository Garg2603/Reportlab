MNLP Report PDF Generator

Introduction

This README file provides instructions on using the Python script generate_pdf.py to create a PDF report containing MNL data and device events. The script utilizes the ReportLab library to generate well-formatted and informative reports.

Requirements

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
ReportLab library (install using pip install reportlab)


Explanation of Functions:

my_can(c): Adds decorative elements (logo, address, etc.) to the first page of the PDF.


my_can2(c): Adds decorative elements (copyright information) to subsequent pages of the PDF.


first_page_elements(input_list): Splits the device data list to extract entries for the first page's table.
other_elements(input_list): Splits the remaining device data for subsequent pages' tables.


split_list(input_list, chunk_size=31): Chunks the device data list into manageable sizes for table creation.


generate_pdf(my_data, my_dict, output_path): The core function that generates the PDF report, performing data processing, table creation, and PDF generation based on the provided data and event information.


How to Use the Script:

Install Requirements: Ensure you have Python 3 and the ReportLab library installed (pip install reportlab).
Edit Data: Modify the my_data and my_dict variables in the script to reflect your actual device data and event details.
Set Output Path: Change the output_path variable to specify where you want to save the generated PDF report.
Run the Script: Execute the script using python generate_pdf.py. This will create the PDF based on your provided data.
Additional Notes:

The script currently assumes specific data structures for my_data and my_dict. You might need to adjust them based on your actual data format.
The script includes functionality to check for available space before creating tables. This helps prevent tables from being cut off across pages.
You can customize the appearance of the report (fonts, colors, layouts) by modifying the styling parameters within the script.
Conclusion

This script provides a solid foundation for generating MNL report PDFs. Feel free to modify it further to fit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the script's code or consult the ReportLab documentation (https://www.reportlab.com/docs/reportlab-userguide.pdf).
