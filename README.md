MNLP Report PDF Generator 


This Python script generates PDF reports containing MNL data (device information) and device event details. It utilizes the ReportLab library to create well-formatted tables with headers like Dev_ID, Dev_Name, and Uptime%. You can customize fonts, colors, and layouts within the code. The script handles page breaks to prevent tables from being cut off. To use it, install ReportLab (pip install reportlab), edit the provided sample data (my_data and my_dict variables), set the desired output path, and run python generate_pdf.py.
